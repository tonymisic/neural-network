- Output layer should be a softmax activation function (not really beneficial for an XOR learning model)
- Visualization of Weights, biases and values to affirm correction of implementation so far
- Back-Propagation implementation
- Training data can be handled and ran on several epochs
- Testing implementation with a return of the error rate
- Compartmentalize into object/class that can be used easily
- Find suitable scalability test and show model can be learned
